    <h1>Petra</h1>
    <p>
        Inhibites since prehistoric times, this <strong>Nabataen</strong>  caravan-city, situated between the Red Sea and the <strong>Dead Sea</strong> ,
        was an important crossroads between Arabia, Egypt and Syria-Phoenicia. Petra is half-carved into the rock, and is 
        surrounded by mountains riddled with passages and gorges. It's one of the world most famous archaeological sites, where ancient <strong>Eastern</strong> 
        traditions blend with <strong>Hellenistic</strong>  architecture.
