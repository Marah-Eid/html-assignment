      Hi im <strong>Marah</strong> One hobby I really enjoy is
      <em>Drawing</em> Ive draw some pretty ones and have not showed them to anyone
      kinda waiting for someone who understand my soul 
   
      My favorite quote is:
      <mark >"What doesnt kill you makes you stronger"</mark>
    
      Chemical formula example: Glucose C<sub>6</sub>H 
      <sub>12</sub> O <sub>6</sub>

      Math equation example: 9<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = z<sup>2</sup>
      I used to think I was <del>not good at coding</del>, but now I believe I am
      <ins>improving step by step</ins>.
